A hands-on workshop on phylogenetic analysis using `Python` and `R`. The workflow included multiple sequence alignment with `MAFFT`, alignment trimming with `trimAl`, model selection with `ModelFinder`, and tree inference using `IQ-TREE2`. `BioPython` was used for data handling, and `phyloki` was employed to fetch `RefSeq` metadata for tree annotation. Final visualizations were produced with `ggtree`, resulting in publication-ready, annotated phylogenies.
