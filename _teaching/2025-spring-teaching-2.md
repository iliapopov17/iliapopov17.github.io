A hands-on workshop on phylogenetic analysis using `Python` and `R`. The pipeline covered MSA with `MAFFT`, trimming with `trimAl`, model selection via `ModelFinder`, and tree inference using `IQ-TREE2`. `BioPython` and `phyloki` were used for metadata integration, with final visualizations generated in `ggtree`.
