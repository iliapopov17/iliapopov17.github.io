Data of WGS-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) or cell-free DNA testing contains exogenous DNA (bacterial and viral). This information is too fragmentary to conduct full microbiome studies, but still interesting for expanding NIPT functionality.<br>

Being a retrovirus, HIV can not be directly detected in cell-free DNA data.<br>

Steps of the study:<br>
    1. Extraction of unmapped reads<br>
    2. Assigning taxonomic labels<br>
    3. **Creating residual virus and microbiome profiles of two datasets** – current step<br>
    4. Analysis of the HIV-positive sequencing data<br>
    5. Finding the differences in exogenous DNA composition between HIV- and HIV+ NIPT samples<br>

The results will be published in the very begining of the May, 2024 in [The-shadow-of-HIV repository](https://github.com/iliapopov17/The-shadow-of-HIV).
