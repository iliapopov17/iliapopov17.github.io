> Detailed Sequences for Trees Unblemished (DSTU) simplifies phylogenetic tree creation in microbiology and virology by facilitating sequence downloads from NCBI GenBank using accession numbers. It also reinstates organism names in trees constructed with IQ-TREE, retrieves host information about microorganisms, and prepares annotation datasets for further visualization in iTOL.

## Features
### Sequence Downloading
- Facilitates the retrieval of sequences from NCBI GenBank using specified accession numbers.

### Organism Name Reintegration
- Enhances IQ-TREE constructed trees by replacing accession numbers with the corresponding organism names for clarity and context.

### Host Information Retrieval
- Gathers host data for each microorganism, including the host's taxonomic order.

### Annotation Dataset Preparation for iTOL
- Utilizes the collected host information to prepare detailed annotation datasets, optimizing visualization in iTOL.
