## Field Work

During the internship, I did a research expedition to the East Nusa Tenggara Province (Kupang City & North Kodi Township). This experience involved participation in the organization and execution of a clinical trial, a significant endeavor aimed at advancing our understanding of probiotic efficacy.<br>

The crux of my responsibilities revolved around assistanship of organization and coordination of a clinical trial. This trial focused on over 200 children distributed across 4 distinct groups. I have visited group №2 & group №4.<br>

Blood and stool samples were systematically gathered from the participants.<br>

## Bioinformatic Works

### Genomic Insights: Unraveling Safety Aspects of Probiotic _Lpb. plantarum_ IS-10506

This [internship report](https://github.com/iliapopov17/PNMIM/tree/main/Genome%20annotation) unveils a comprehensive genome-based safety assessment of the probiotic strain _Lpb. plantarum_ IS-10506. The study explores bacteriocin clusters and CRISPR sequences, shedding light on its antimicrobial potential and defense mechanisms.

### Microbial Insights: Examining Gut Differences in Growing Children

This [internship report](https://github.com/iliapopov17/PNMIM/tree/main/Metagenomic%20assay) presents a multivariate analysis of the relationship between clinical metadata and microbiome characteristics in a comparative study of gut microbiota profiles in stunted and normal growing children aged 36-45 months. V3-V4 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing data from faecal samples of the children participating in the study were used for the analyses.
