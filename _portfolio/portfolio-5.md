The data analysis of shotgun metagenomic data from bats fecal samples was so complex that there are 4 different parts of it!<br>
See lab journals and some supplementary files in directories:
- 📁 [`01_QC_n_tax_id`](https://github.com/PopovIILab/BatShotMetaFlow/tree/main/01_QC_n_tax_id) - quality control & taxonomic identification step
- 📁 [`02_Diff_analysis`](https://github.com/PopovIILab/BatShotMetaFlow/tree/main/02_Diff_analysis) - microbial community analysis (relative abundance, differential abundance analysis, α & β diversities assessment)
- 📁 [`03_MAGs`](https://github.com/PopovIILab/BatShotMetaFlow/tree/main/03_MAGs) - assembling MAGs and analyzing them from quality control to the detailed functional profiling
- 📁 [`04_Densoviruses`](https://github.com/PopovIILab/BatShotMetaFlow/tree/main/04_Densoviruses) - analyzing _densoviruses_ (genome annotation, ANI, phylogenomics)
