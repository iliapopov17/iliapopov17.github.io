PCR screening of hantaviruses in samples from bats in Rostov-on-Don showed some positive results. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolated viruses are closely related to _Brno loanviruses_ found in Central Europe, suggesting they might be the same virus.<br>

This research demonstrates that _Brno loanvirus_ has a wide area of habitat: from Central Europe to Southern Russia.

Steps of the analysis:<br>
    1. Downloading sequences from `NCBI`<br>
    2. Multiple Sequence Alignment using `MAFFT`<br>
    3. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstruction using `ModelFinder` & `IQ-TREE2`<br>
    4. Plotting _Brno loanviruses_ area of habitat using `rnaturalearth`<br>
