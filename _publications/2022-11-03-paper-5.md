#excerpt: 'The study discusses two cases of Infectious Endocarditis (IE) in cats, a disease characterized by inflammation of the endocardium and lesions on the heart valve apparatus. The first case was challenging to diagnose due to the rapid progression of the disease, with the catâ€™s condition deteriorating significantly within 48 hours of a normal initial echocardiogram result. In the second case, a histopathological examination confirmed an infectious inflammatory process of unclear origin in the endocardium and myocardium. However, the lack of additional laboratory tests, such as bacterial blood culture and PCR diagnosis, limited the ability to propose a hypothesis about the origin and etiology of IE. The study highlights the need for a clear diagnostic algorithm for IE in cats.'
