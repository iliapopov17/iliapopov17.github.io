#excerpt: 'The study focuses on the threat of Coronaviruses (CoVs), particularly those originating from bats, due to their high mutation rate. A meta-analysis found a 9.8% prevalence of CoVs in bats. The study conducted a qPCR screening of CoVs in the bat population of Fore-Caucasus and attempted to characterize them using metagenomic NGS. CoV RNA was detected in 5 samples, indicating a 3.33% prevalence in these locations. BetaCoVs reads were identified in the raw metagenomic NGS data, but detailed characterization was limited due to low RNA concentration. The study suggests a need for further research using deeper metagenomic NGS for detailed CoV characterization.'
