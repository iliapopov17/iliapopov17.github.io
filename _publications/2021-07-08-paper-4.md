# excerpt: 'The study evaluates the use of micro-computed tomography in assessing penile cavernous fibrosis in animal models, comparing it with other methods like histological, histochemical, and immunohistochemical analysis. The experiment involved 25 New Zealand male rabbits with induced testosterone deficiency. The study found that micro-computed tomography provided a 3D visualization of the entire corpora cavernosa and could track fibrosis progression through gray value analysis. However, it was found that RT-PCR could not be conducted on samples studied by micro-CT due to RNA destruction. The study suggests that micro-CT could potentially affect the immunohistochemical outcome, as an increase in TGF-beta-1 expression was observed later than histological signs of fibrosis.'
