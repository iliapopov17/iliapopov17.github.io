#excerpt: 'The study analyzes the gut microbiota of different bat species and finds that microbial diversity varies significantly between insectivorous and fructivorous bats, suggesting that diet influences gut microbiota more than species. The study also identifies several bacteria in the gut microbiota of synanthropic bats that are important for public health and animal welfare. These findings provide a basis for future research into the role of bats in microbial ecology.'
