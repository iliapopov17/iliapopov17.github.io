excerpt: 'The study analyzes the gut microbiota of different bat species and finds that microbial diversity varies significantly between insectivorous and fructivorous bats, suggesting that diet influences gut microbiota more than species. The study also identifies several bacteria in the gut microbiota of synanthropic bats that are important for public health and animal welfare. These findings provide a basis for future research into the role of bats in microbial ecology.'

Bats are natural reservoirs for many emerging viral diseases. That is why their virome is widely studied. But at the same time, studies of their bacterial gut microbiota are limited, creating a degree of uncertainty about the role of bats in global microbial ecology. In this study, we analyzed gut microbiota of insectivorous _Nyctalus noctula_ and _Vespertilio murinus_ from rehabilitation centers from Rostov-on-Don and Moscow, respectively, and fructivorous _Carollia perspicillata_ from the Moscow Zoo based on V3–V4 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing. We revealed that microbial diversity significantly differs between the insectivorous and fructivorous species studied, while the differences between _N. noctula_ and _V. murinus_ are less pronounced, which shows that bats’ gut microbiota is not strictly species-specific and depends more on diet type. In the gut microbiota of synanthropic bats, we observed bacteria that are important for public health and animal welfare such as _Bacteroides_, _Enterobacter_, _Clostridiaceae_, _Enterococcus_, _Ureaplasma_, _Faecalibacterium_, and _Helicobacter_, as well as some lactic acid bacteria such as _Pediococcus_, _Lactobacillus_, _Lactococcus_, and _Weisella_. All these bacteria, except for _Bacteroides_ and _Weisella_, were significantly less abundant in _C. perspicillata_. This study provides a direct metagenomic comparison of synanthropic insectivorous and zoo fructivorous bats, suggesting future directions for studying these animals’ role in microbial ecology.
