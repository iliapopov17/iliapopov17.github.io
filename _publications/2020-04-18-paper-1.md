# excerpt: 'The study aims to understand the morphological changes and severity of fibrogenic processes in the penis due to hypotestosteronemia. Using 20 white male rabbits, the study induced penile cavernous fibrosis through bilateral orchiectomy. The testosterone levels were monitored for 28 days, and penile tissue biopsies were examined. The results showed a significant decrease in testosterone levels and clear morphological changes in the penis by day 7 post-castration, with severe fibrotic changes by day 28. The study suggests revising the therapeutic effect timeframe in similar studies.'
