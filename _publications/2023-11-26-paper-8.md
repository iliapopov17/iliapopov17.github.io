#excerpt: 'The study explores how hibernation affects the gut microbiota of bats. It found that hibernation significantly changes the composition and diversity of gut microbiota. Certain microorganisms were more abundant in hibernating bats, while others were more prevalent in active bats before hibernation. The findings highlight the need for further research into this area.'
