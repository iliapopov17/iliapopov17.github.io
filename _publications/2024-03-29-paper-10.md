#excerpt: 'The study investigates the gut microbiota of stunted and non-stunted children in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. It found that certain bacteria were more prevalent in stunted children and correlated with their growth parameters. The study also found lower concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in stunted children, indicating lower energy extraction by their gut microbiota. These findings suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in stunting, but further studies are needed to confirm this.'
