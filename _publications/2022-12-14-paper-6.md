collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-12-14-paper-6
#excerpt: 'The text discusses the zoonotic origin of over 60% of human viral pathogens, with bats being reservoirs for various viruses, including coronaviruses. It highlights three major outbreaks since the 2000s: SARS in 2002, MERS in 2012, and COVID-19 in 2019. These outbreaks are believed to be linked to evolutionary processes driven by environmental and genetic factors. The text suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, originated from a bat of the genus Rhinolophus and is now transmitted globally through human-to-human contact. Various animal species are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, but natural infections have only been reported in certain animals, including domestic dogs and cats, zoo animals, and farm-raised mink and ferrets. Notably, animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has only been reported from mink to humans on mink farms.'
