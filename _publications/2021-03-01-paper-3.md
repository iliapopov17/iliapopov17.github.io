# excerpt: 'The paper discusses the evolutionary potential of coronaviruses, highlighting three major outbreaks in recent human history. It explores the patterns of new zoonotic coronavirus infections, the role of bioveterinary control in preventing future outbreaks, and the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection in companion animals. The paper also considers how diverse human activities can trigger interactions between animal species and their viruses, potentially leading to new viral pathogens. Lastly, it discusses the potential use of probiotics to control viral infections in animals.'

Coronaviruses have tremendous evolutionary potential, and three major outbreaks of new human coronavirus infections have occurred in the recent history of humankind. In this paper, the patterns of occurrence of new zoonotic coronavirus infections and the role of bioveterinary control in preventing their potential outbreaks in the future are determined. The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in companion animals is considered. Diverse human activities may trigger various interactions between animal species and their viruses, sometimes causing the emergence of new viral pathogens. In addition, the possibility of using probiotics for the control of viral infections in animals is discussed.
