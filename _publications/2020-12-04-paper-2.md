collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-12-04-paper-2
# excerpt: 'This paper discusses the limitations of current imaging methods in pre-clinical and animal model studies of penile disease, particularly due to the small size of the rat penis. It presents a comparative study of ultrasound, histopathological analysis, and micro-computed tomography, concluding that micro-computed tomography, due to its ability to provide a three-dimensional view, should be the primary method used in pre-clinical trials and animal model studies.'
