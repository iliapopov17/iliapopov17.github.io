Welcome! I'm a medical graduate with retraining in bioinformatics.<br>
My passion for microbiology, sparked during my 2nd year of university, leading me to specialize in bioinformatics.<br>

🧑🏻‍🔬 In my final year of medical school, I [interned in BINUS University](https://github.com/iliapopov17/PNMIM), studying gut microbiota in stunted and normal children in Indonesia, with published [results](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299349).<br>

🦠 Then, I greatly improved my skills and knowledge during my studies at the Bioinformatics Institute. This resulted in a [research project](https://github.com/iliapopov17/The-shadow-of-HIV) aimed to detect indirect signs of HIV infection in cell-free DNA samples.<br>

🦇 Now I work at [Bat Rehab Lab](https://github.com/PopovIILab) at DSTU, applying my knowledge and skills to achieve top-tier results.<br>

I continuously advance my knowledge through ongoing [professional development](https://iliapopov17.github.io/certificates/).<br>

In my free time, I love 📚, ✈️, and 🚴🏻!
