Welcome! I'm a medical graduate with retraining in bioinformatics.<br>
My passion for microbiology, especially intestinal microbiology, sparked during my 2nd year of university, leading me to specialize in bioinformatics.<br>

In my final year of medical school, I [interned in Indonesia](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/), studying gut microbiota in stunted and normal children, with published [results](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299349).<br>

Then, during my studies at the Bioinformatics Institute, I greatly improved my skills and knowledge in this field. This resulted in a [research project](https://github.com/iliapopov17/The-shadow-of-HIV) aimed to detect indirect signs of HIV infection in cell-free DNA samples.<br>

Now I work at Bat Rehab Lab at Don State Technical University, applying my knowledge and skills to achieve [top-tier results](https://github.com/PopovIILab).<br>

I continuously advance my knowledge through ongoing [professional development](https://iliapopov17.github.io/certificates/).<br>

In my free time, I love reading, traveling, and cycling!
