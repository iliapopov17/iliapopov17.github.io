Hi! My name is Ilia Popov (aka Ilya).<br>
I have a medical degree and I'm about to graduate as a bioinformatician. Since my 2nd year of medical university I have been endlessly fascinated by the world of microbiology, specifically the mind-blowing world of intestinal microbiology! This is why I decided to develop in the field of bioinformatics.<br>

### Research Internship

Last year, I did a research internship in Indonesia studying the composition and properties of the gut microbiota in stunted and normal children. The internship report is available [here](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/). The results are published [here](https://iliapopov17.github.io/publication/2024-03-29-paper-10).<br>

### Bioinformatics Institute

I am now completing my studies at the Bioinformatics Institute, and during this time I have learnt a lot of new things as well as consolidated previously learnt skills. For example, I have written two simple tools: [SequenceForge-Lite](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/) and [MyAwesomeEDA](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-4/). I plan to further develop my skills in Python and will probably write a more complex utility in the future.<br>
I have also completed 7 projects focusing on applied bioinformatics. Detailed reports on them are available in my [portfolio](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-5/). The lab journals can be found there as well by following the link to each specific project.<br>
In addition, I really enjoyed studying phylogenetics, and I have described a complete phylogenetic research pipeline. This helps me to constantly remember all the skills I have learnt. You can find my contributions in my [portfolio](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-6/).<br>
My Researh Project is about searching for indirect signs of HIV infection in cell-free DNA samples. The results will be published in this [repository](https://github.com/iliapopov17/The-shadow-of-HIV) be the beginning of May.<br>

### Don State Technical University

While working at Don State Technical University, I joined Igor Popov's group in Alexey Ermakov's lab. I applied all the knowledge and skills I learnt in order to achieve first-class results. The results of the work can be found in [publications](https://iliapopov17.github.io/publications/).<br>

### Hobbies

I really enjoy reading books, travelling and also cycling!<br>

Favourite books:<br>
* Paul de Kruif - Microbe Hunters<br>
* Peter Talantov - 0.05. Evidence-based medicine from magic to the quest for immortality (RU)<br>
* Andrei Lankov - North of the 38th Parallel: How People Live in the DPRK (RU)<br>

Countries and cities visited:<br>
* Indonesia: Jakarta, Kupang, Sumba island, Bandung, Bali<br>
* Malaysia, Kuala-Lumpur<br>
* Singapore<br>
* Japan, Tokyo<br>

The best cycling location yet: Rowing Channel, Rostov-on-Don<br>

Sometimes I like to write detailed [manuals on NGS data analysis](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-7/), as I remember how hard my studies were for me, and I hope that in the near future my materials can help someone a lot.<br>
