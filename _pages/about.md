Hi! My name is Ilia Popov (aka Ilya).<br>
I have a medical degree and and have completed a retraining programme in bioinformatics. Since my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of university I have been endlessly fascinated by the world of microbiology, specifically the mind-blowing world of intestinal microbiology! This is why I decided to develop in the field of bioinformatics.<br>

### Research Internship

Last year, I did an internship in Indonesia studying the composition and properties of the gut microbiota in stunted and normal children. The report is available [here](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/), the results are published [here](https://iliapopov17.github.io/publication/2024-03-29-paper-10).<br>

### Studying at the Bioinformatics Institute

During my studies I’ve developed two simple tools, [SequenceForge-Lite](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/) and [MyAwesomeEDA](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-4/), and plan to further enhance my Python skills. I’ve completed nine applied bioinformatics projects, with detailed reports and lab journals available in my [portfolio](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-5/). I've thoroughly explored phylogenetics, outlining a complete research [pipeline](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-6/). My research project involved detecting indirect signs of HIV infection in cell-free DNA samples, with results published [here](https://github.com/iliapopov17/The-shadow-of-HIV).

### Working at Don State Technical University

At Don State Technical University, I collaborated with Igor Popov’s group in Alexey Ermakov’s lab, applying my knowledge and skills to achieve top-tier results.<br>

### Hobbies

I really enjoy reading books, travelling and cycling!<br>

Occasionally, I enjoy writing detailed [handbook on NGS data analysis](https://iliapopov17.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-7/), driven by the memory of the challenges I faced during my own studies. My aspiration is that these materials will serve as valuable resources to others in their learning journeys in the near future.
